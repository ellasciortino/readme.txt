Project Description: 

The aim of this project is to provide code that will allow for easy analysis of behavior from data gained from a Go/No-Go conditioning paradigm. I have been working in a Lab since this previous summer and asked to use some data from our lab but you could use this using any behavioral data as long as there are Hit Rates, False Alarm Rates, Correct rejections, and Misses. I also added a graph that anaylzes difference in Genotypes, as most experiements use WT and geneticaly modified rodents/animals. The data I obtained for this project only uses one genotype however the code I think could still be interesting for a later time/user!

Please start by Downloading the TTS data file and placing it in the same Directory as my .py file.

Then you will choose two rats out of a list of four to compare. Please enter the number, NOT THE NAME. It will give you an error message if you type in the name.

Then you will be shown some graphs that analyze the behavior metrics of the two rats you selected. And given a brief description of what those graphs represent.

Thank you for using my code I hope it is intersing/helpful!
